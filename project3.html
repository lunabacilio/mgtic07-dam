        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="project-text">A prototype of a mobile application for pet adoption was developed using Expo as the core technology. The primary goal of this prototype is to serve as a visual and conceptual reference for a future functional application focused on connecting adopters with pets in need of a home. To optimize the design and development process, generative artificial intelligence was leveraged, enabling faster requirement definition, interface creation, and code generation. This approach facilitated the structuring of the application and the exploration of different concepts before full implementation.The prototype includes key screens such as user registration, pet profile browsing, and an intuitive interface for exploring adoption options. While it does not yet have active functionality, it establishes a solid foundation for future development, allowing for quick iterations and design validations before a full-scale build. Thanks to Expo and React Native, the prototype is scalable and adaptable to various mobile devices, making future expansion easier. This project demonstrates how modern tools, combined with generative AI, can accelerate the initial development phase and improve application conceptualization.</p>
