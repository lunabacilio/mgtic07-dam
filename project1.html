        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="project-text">A web application was developed using Python and the Flask library to retrieve real-time weather information. The application integrates with the Open-Meteo API, an open-source service that provides free and accurate weather data. The main objective of the application is to display the temperature and probability of rain from one hour before the current time. To achieve this, it communicates with the Open-Meteo API, sending requests to retrieve historical temperature and precipitation data. Flask was used to build the application's backend, allowing HTTP request handling and presenting the retrieved data in an accessible format for users. The application follows a simple yet efficient architecture, ensuring fast response times and a lightweight implementation that facilitates deployment in various environments. Thanks to its modular design, the application can be easily expanded to include additional weather metrics or integrate with other climate analysis services. Moreover, by utilizing an open-source API like Open-Meteo, it ensures unrestricted access to data, promoting the use of open tools for weather analysis. This project demonstrates how effective solutions can be built with Flask, leveraging public APIs to obtain valuable real-time information.</p>
